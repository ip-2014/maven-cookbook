  <title>Foreword: ${project.version}</title>

  <para>This is an initial pre-alpha for the Maven Cookbook. I hate to call
  this a book at the moment: one chapter, a cover, and a copyright statement
  is more a pamphlet than a book. But, everything has to have a beginning, and
  (in the interest of openness) why not distribute the information as it
  appears, chapter by chapter. Enjoy, and if you want us to write about
  something specific, just ask. We're continuing to take requests.</para>
