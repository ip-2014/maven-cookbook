  <title>Foreword: ${project.version}</title>

  <para>This is an initial alpha version of the Maven Cookbook, and I mean
  "pre-alpha". If you are coming to the book with the expectation that this is
  a polished product, please check back in a few months. I'm convinced that
  this will be a better book because people are going to have a window into
  the process, you will be able to see the false starts, outline revisions,
  and other parts of the writing process that are usually hidden from view.
  You'll be able to give us feedback and reviews even before we've stated that
  the content is ready for review.</para>
