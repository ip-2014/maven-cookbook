  <title>Foreword: ${project.version}</title>

  <para>This is an initial alpha version of the Maven Cookbook, and I mean
  "pre-alpha". If you are coming to the book with the expectation that this is
  a polished product, please check back in a few months, we're going to be
  developing this content over the next few months, and you should expect at
  least two chapters a month for the next five or six. I'm convinced that this
  will be a better book because people are going to have a window into the
  process, you will be able to see the false starts, outline revisions, and
  other parts of the writing process that are usually hidden from view. You'll
  be able to give us feedback and reviews even before we've stated that the
  content is ready for review.</para>
